				<p>The bedroom, a place that should be dedicated to rest and repose, is too often a dumping ground for things to be repaired, clothes to be returned, items to donate, and detritus that doesn't fit anywhere else in the home. With so many of us plagued by insomnia, there's even more reason to keep your sleeping quarters a place where you can relax and take quiet time for yourself.</p>

				<p>Use the top drawer of your dresser to store unsightly lotion bottles, deodorant, and anything else cluttering up the surface of your dresser. Use inexpensive plastic bins, like these from Muji, to keep it organized; don't just dump it all in there! A tray can hold a curated selection of items you'd like on the top of the dresser, and a little bowl or dish can contain often-worn jewelry.</p>

				<p>If you like to have access to a lot of things near your bed, get a closed nightstand, one with drawers and/or a cabinet door. Splurging? Try this walnut-fronted number from Organic Modernism. Saving? Ikea to the rescue. If you have an open shelf, use a basket to corral and hide books, tissues, et al.</p>

				<p>Storing things under the bed should be an absolute last resort. If you absolutely must, get large drawers or bins that can be easily pulled out and cleaned off once a week, or a few times a month.</p>

				<p>Install hooks on the back of the door or wall behind the door (so you don't have to see them when settling into bed), to organize clothes to air out before going back in closet, your robe, and clothes for tomorrow.</p>

				<p>Nightstands with matching bedside lamps are a no-brainer. Or, better yet, hangmodern sconces. Not only do they give the room a more finished look, harsh overhead lights can keep your body from transitioning into sleep.</p>
