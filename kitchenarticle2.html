				<p>"White is the most versatile color," says Christopher Peacock. "You can change the look in a minute with bright kitchen towels, colorful appliances, a vase of flowers, or a bowl of fruit." Just remember to keep it simple. "If you get too fancy," says Mark Williams, "you risk sacrificing the visual serenity."</p>

				<p>"Spend money on good cabinets and they won't ever feel dated," says Sarah Blank of Sarah Blank Design Studio. "Look to the architectural details of the home or photos of butler's pantries from the past for inspiration. The height of the cabinetry, the size of the doors, and the shape of the panels are all part of the aesthetic." Also, as Denise McGaha notes: "It's important to vary the finishes when you have an all-white palette. If your cabinets have a high sheen, then hone the countertops."</p>

				<p>"After your cabinets, the second-largest impact points are your countertops and backsplash," says Mark Williams. "Do something unexpected, like putting a traditional veined stone with a modern cabinet, or a modern quartz composite with a traditional cabinet. If your backsplash is a focal point, keep your counters clutter-free to show it off."</p>

				<p>"A white kitchen can be super-chic, but make sure your flooring is darker to add a bit of contrast to the space," says Denise McGaha. "I like wood floors, and if they're wire-brushed and paired with lacquered white cabinets, I am instantly in love."</p>

				<p>"Try not to put cabinets too close to the windows, because it restricts the flow of natural light," says Mick de Giulio. "Create some drama with handsome, overscale pendants on dimmers, so they can work as both task and ambient lighting. Under-the-cabinet or over-the-cabinet lights can be very atmospheric, or you could cover a wide area with recessed lights. The idea is to combine decorative and practical lighting to make a harmonious and functional design."</p>
